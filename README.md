# kindleHightlightExtractor
This class aims to help to extract Hightlights and Notes from the "My Clippings.txt" file that can be downloaded from Kindle devices connected via USB.

I use it in order to create a flashcards where the Hightlight is the response and the Note is the question, so I can test myself upon books I study.
